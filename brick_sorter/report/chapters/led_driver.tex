\section{LED driver}
The LED driver determines which LED is on at any given time.
Only one LED is on at a time such that the reflection of each color can be measured by the photodiode, without.
A criteria set by the hardware of the LED driver is that the LED has to be turned on for 13 $\mu$s such that output of the photodiode can settle, and a steady analog value can be read from the photodiode.

The LED driver is implemented with 2 process , \texttt{state\_changer} and \texttt{LED\_process}. 

\texttt{State\_changer} consists of an  FSM which has three states , \texttt{Red}, \texttt{Green}, \texttt{Blue} which each turn on their respective LED, and turn off the others.  The FSM start at \texttt{Red}.  At this state the \texttt{led\_red} is set to be high.\\


In \texttt{LED\_process}  is  variable named \texttt{count} incremented for each \texttt{rising\_edge} of the CLK..  When \texttt{count} goes above 650, will 13 us have passed, and  \texttt{start\_ADC} wil be set high, which the component ADC will use to know when it can start to convert the analog value of the photodiode. While count is below it \texttt{start\_adc} kept low.  \\

The FSM changes state when \texttt{next\_state} is read as high,  when it is read as low it will stay at the same state. 

%% May have to remove LED_on.. Don't have to turn them off..
