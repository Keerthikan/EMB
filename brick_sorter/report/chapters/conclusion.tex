\section{Conclusion}
The parts necessary for creating the brick sorter have been developed. 
A board was designed for the power supply, It has been tested to verify that it conforms with the requirements set up in the project specification. 
It was not possible to reach the 80\% efficiency required due to limitations on the step-down switching regulator.
Additionally a board was designed for housing the LEDs, the photodiode and the amplifier circuit for the photodiode.
A list of components were written: A component maintaining communication with the ADC, A driver for the servo motor and an LED driver. 
Finally a control module was written to connect aforementioned components, as well as provide the logic used to sort the bricks.
$\mu$TosNet was added to provide an interface between a PC and the FPGA. 
While all of the components of the project are functional, connecting them has been unsuccessful and at time of writing the system is not capable of sorting bricks based on colour.
