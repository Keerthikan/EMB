\section{$\mu$TosNet}
As the implementation process of $\mu$TosNet was provided as a guide for the project, not much effort will be given to explain these steps. 
Instead, the application is briefly explained.

A small c++ application is written in order to establish a serial connection between a PC and the FPGA.
This application enables the transfer of information between the two. 
This is utilized, currently, only to read the three ADC values read when either the red, green or blue LED is on.
